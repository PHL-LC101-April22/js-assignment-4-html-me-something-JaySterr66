   <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">Every other year, I travel with my family to Massachusetts to visit the towns of Cape Cod, Martha&#39s Vineyard and Provincetown.
      Some of my favorite things about these locations are the cuisine, the hospitality of the locals and the scenic views.
            I highlight some my favorite things to do.</testP>
   <h2>Historical and Fun Facts</h2>
   <p>Cape Cod was named after the English Explorer, Bartholomew Gosnold who visited in 1602.  
   In 1620, the Pilgrims landed on shore on what is now called Provincetown, located on the tip of the island.</p>
   Mr. Gosnold named the island after his daughter, Martha, as well the vines that were growing along the coast, hence <em> Martha&#39;s Vineyard</em>.</p>

<h3 Cape Cod id="Cape Cod">Cape Cod</h3>
<p>I always stay in Hyannis because it is a walkable town, and easy to get around by foot.
There is basically something to do for everyone, from enjoying the sunny beaches to shopping to visiting the JFK Museum.
The Kennedy Compound is located in Hyannis.  For any one interested, you may try to get as close as security will let you to take pictures.</p>  
I like to stroll up and down Main Street and enjoy lunch at the one of many restaurants 
that overlook the Harbor.</p>

<h3 Provincetown id="Provincetown">Provincetown</h3>
<p>Provincetown has a very rich and interesting history.  It is the home of the Pilgrim Monument, which is 
   a large granite structure erected to pay homage to the Pilgrims.  
   The town has a very large LGBTQ community and many people like to visit during the month of June for Pride festivities. </p>

<p>Another interesting place to visit is the protected sand dunes. The sand dunes were established as a National Park by the late President John F. Kennedy in 1961.</p>
The shacks on the dunes have been used by artists, playwrights and writers over the years.  
I enjoy the beauty of the untouched landscape.</p>

<p>There are some interesting shops to discover and after shopping, I always have my two favorite things to eat while here which are lobster rolls and, for a treat, a ginger ice cream cone.</p>

</p>
<h3 Martha&#39s Vineyard id="Martha&#39s Vineyard">Martha&#39s Vineyard</h3>
<p>Is a quaint little town, with old style cottages and lighthouses.  It is a town full of New England charm and it's like taking a step back in time!
   While here, I usually visit Oak Bluffs, which is known as the hub of the African American community and some of the stops on the 
   Martha&#39s Vineyard African-American Heritage Trail can be found on the island.</p>

<h3>Travel information</h3>
<p>To get to the island, I take the ferry, which is operated by the Steamship Authority.  It boards from the town of Woods Hole. 
You can even put your car on the Ferry if you prefer.  The ride is about 45 minutes long and it's a great opportunity to sit back, relax and enjoy the view of the Atlantic Ocean.</p>

   Once I disembark, I tour the island, explore the shops and boutiques and ask the locals for restaurant recommendations.  Typically I eat a lot of seafood.  It's very fresh.
   This is one of my favorite places to visit and I highly recommend visiting.</p>
