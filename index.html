         <h1>New England, Massachusetts</h1>
         <p>Cape Cod, Martha's Vineyard and Provincetown.</p>
   </head>
         <p>Every other year, I travel with my family to Massachusetts to visit Cape Cod, Martha's Vineyard and Provincetown.
         </p>
         <h2>Historical and Fun Facts</h2>
         <p><em>Cape Cod</em> was named after the English Explorer, Bartholomew Gosnold who visited in 1602.</p>  
            <p>In 1620, the Pilgrims landed on the site of <em>Provincetown</em>, on the tip of the island which is the site of Provincetown.</p>
            <p>Mr. Gosnold named <em>Martha's Vineyard</em> after his daughter, Martha, and the vines growing along the coast.</p>
            <p>He actually concatenated the two names (points for code-speak???)</p>
            </p>
         
         <p>Some of my favorite things about these locations are the cuisine, the hospitality of the locals and the scenic views.
         I highlight some my favorite things to do.</p>

      <h3>Cape Cod</h3>
      <p></p>I always stay in Hyannis because it is a walkable town, easy to get from one end to the other.
      There is basically something for everyone to do, from beaches to shopping to visiting the JFK Museum.  
      I like to take a morning walk up and down Main Street and enjoy lunch at the many restaurants 
      that overlook the Harbor.</p>
      <p>The Kennedy Compound is located in Hyannis.  For any one interested, you may try to get as close security will let you to take pictures.</p>       
      
      <h3>Provincetown</h3>
   <p>Has a very interesting history -- it is the home of the Pilgrim Monument.
      <p>This large, granite structure was dedicated to pilgrims. <img src = "images/pilgrim monument.jpg" alt ="Pilgrim Monument."></p>
   <p>Another interesting place to visit are the protected sand dunes. The sand dunes were established as a National Park by the late President John F. Kennedy in 1961.</p>
   Further the shacks on the dunes have been used by artists, playwrights and writers over the years.  I enjoy the beauty of the untouched landscape.  Although I always get the same thing, a lobster roll.</p>
   My favorite things eat while there are the lobster rolls and, for a treat, ginger ice cream.</p>

   <h3>Martha's Vineyard</h3>
      <p>Is a quaint little town, with old style cottages, lighthouses and full of New England charm.  It is like taking a step back in time!
      We get there via the Steamship Authority from the town of Woods Hole.  
      The ferry ride is about 40 minutes long and it's a great opportunity to sit back, relax and enjoy the view of the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
      Here's more information about the ferry <a href="https://www.steamshipauthority.com">Steam Ship Authority</a>
      Once I disembark, I tour the island, explore the shops and boutiques and enjoy a meal.  I typically ask the locals for restaurant recommendations.
      This is one of my favorite places to visit and I highly recommend visiting.</p>

               <h2>Interesting fact about Martha's Vineyard</h2>
               <p>Martha's Vineyard was the home to one of the earliest deaf communities in the US.  
                  A form of sign language, Martha's Vineyard Sign Language emerged as a result.
                  <p>The movie <em>Jaws</em> was filmed there.  <embed src="https://archive.org/details/jaws_20210113"></embed>
