      <h1>My trip to New England, Massachusetts</h1>
      <h2>My favorite places to visit:  Cape Cod, Martha&#39;s Vineyard and Provincetown.</h2>
         
   </head>
   <body>
      <p>Every other year, I travel with my family to Massachusetts to visit Cape Cod, Martha's Vineyard and Provincetown.
   </p>
   <h2>Historical and Fun Facts</h2>
   <p><em>Cape Cod</em> was named after the English Explorer, Bartholomew Gosnold who visited in 1602.</p>  
      <p>In 1620, the Pilgrims landed on the site of <em>Provincetown</em>, on the tip of the island which is the site of Provincetown.</p>
      <p>Mr. Gosnold named <em>Martha's Vineyard</em> after his daughter, Martha, and the vines growing along the coast.</p>
      <p>He actually concatenated the two names (points for code-speak???)</p>
      </p>
   
   <p>Some of my favorite things about these locations are the cuisine, the hospitality of the locals and the scenic views.
   I highlight some my favorite things to do.</p>

<h3>Cape Cod</h3>
<p></p>I always stay in Hyannis because it is a walkable town, and easy to get from one end to the other by foot.
There is basically something for everyone to do, from beaches to shopping to visiting the JFK Museum.  
I like to take a morning walk up and down Main Street and enjoy lunch at the many restaurants 
that overlook the Harbor.</p>
<p>The Kennedy Compound is located in Hyannis.  
For any one interested, you may try to get as close security will let you to take pictures.</p>       

<h3>Provincetown</h3>
<p>Provincetown has a very rich history and interesting history.  It is the home of the Pilgrim Monument, which is 
   large granite structure erected to pay homage to the Pilgrims.  
   It has a very large LBGTQ community and many people tend to visit for Pride Week. </p>

<p>Another interesting place to visit are the protected sand dunes. The sand dunes were established as a National Park by the late President John F. Kennedy in 1961.</p>
The shacks on the dunes have been used by artists, playwrights and writers over the years.  
I enjoy the beauty of the untouched landscape.
My favorite things eat while there are the lobster rolls and, for a treat, ginger ice cream.</p>

<h3>Martha's Vineyard</h3>
<p>Is a quaint little town, with old style cottages, lighthouses.  It is a town full of New England charm and it's like taking a step back in time!
   One thing I like about Oak Bluffs it is known as the hub of the African American community and some of the stops on the 
   Martha's Vineyard African-American Heritage Trail can be found on the island.</p>

<h3>Travel information</h3>
<p>To get to the island, I take the ferry, which is operated by the Steamship Authority.  It boards from the town of Woods Hole. 
   You can even put your car on the Ferry if you prefer.  The ride is about 45 minutes long and it's a great opportunity to sit back, relax and enjoy the view of the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
For more information about the ferry: <a href="https://www.steamshipauthority.com">Steam Ship Authority</a>
Once I disembark, I tour the island, explore the shops and boutiques and ask the locals for restaurant recommendations.  Typically I eat a seafood.  It's very fresh.
This is one of my favorite places to visit and I highly recommend visiting.</p>

         <h2>Interesting fact about Martha's Vineyard</h2>
         <p>Martha's Vineyard was the home to one of the earliest deaf communities in the US.  
            A form of sign language called 'Martha's Vineyard Sign Language' emerged as a result.
            <p>The movie <em>Jaws</em> was filmed there.  <embed src="https://archive.org/details/jaws_20210113"></embed>
